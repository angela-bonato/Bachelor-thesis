    "### Intervals analysis with fixed on-time\n",
    "Since we noticed a drecreasing trend characterizing $\\sigma_\\mathrm{tot}$ as a function of $t_\\mathrm{off}$, and since $f_\\mathrm{sky}(t_\\mathrm{off})$ presents an increasing trend, we hypothesized that these trends are a consequence of the dependence of $\\mu$ (i.e., the mean value used to evaluate the standard deviations) from $t_\\mathrm{off}$. To verify this assumption, we repeat the calculation of $\\sigma_\\mathrm{tot}$ performed in the intervals analysis, with a value of $\\mu$ constant as a function of $t_\\mathrm{off}$. To do so, we fix the number of periods (each equal to $t_\\mathrm{on}+t_\\mathrm{off}$) instead of the total duration of the simulation."
